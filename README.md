# Pipboy-Project
HTML/JS Study. Phaser framework for building game study

# How to run
Just pull and run the index.html.


# Why ?
One of my first project while learning HTML.
This is just pure HTML & CSS and some js for hard-coded data.

I also wanted to learn to make HTML5 games at that time so I looked into making Breakout.
Two version of this is included, one with pure HTML5 and one using the Phaser framework.
